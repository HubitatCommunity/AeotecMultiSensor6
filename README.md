Aeon Labs or Aeotec's MultiSensor6 Hubitat Driver

There are far too many "AeonMultiSensor6 V1" drivers out there and no clear way to distinguish. 

This driver has been through many coders with the most recent being Chuckles. 

Thanks to all who have contributed.

Hubitat introduced a common Security Method in Platform v2.2.3 that encompasses S0 and S2. However, that means using the method requires the platform, first.

<b>Aeotec MultiSensor 6 v2 therefore needs a minimum of Hubitat Platform v2.2.3.</b>

Aeotec MultiSensor 6 v1.x will work on Hubitat Platform v2.2.3 and earlier.
